<P>C is a higher level language, we were have having C programming as a subject in the 2nd Semester, and I have secured "A" Grade in C programming language. as "C" is the very basic format of language it also motivated me to go and wxplore other languages like java,python etc.

<P>Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language. Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure. Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order. Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure. we were having DSA with "C" as a subject in our 3rd Semester, and I have secured "A" Grade in it.</P>

<P>C++ is a general-purpose programming language , we were have "Object Oriented Programming with C++" as a Subject in our 4th Semester, and I have secured "A" Grade in it. it was a simple Language,learning it was very intresting.it is an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".

<P>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. i have done a course of python with udemy, also i have done training under Eduvance on "python and ML", where we used basics of python</P>

<P>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence.Watson is a question-answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci.I have successfully completed training under this course this is very intresting topic. I have also done 2 minor and 1 major project with ML. I have also used Watson for Machine Learning</P>
